# Water Wise: Sustainable Water Management System for IIT Guwahati

##  Overview
**Water Wise** is a data-driven case study and strategic proposal designed to optimize the water lifecycle at the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Guwahati. The project identifies critical inefficiencies in current water procurement, treatment, and distribution systems and proposes a multi-tiered solution involving real-time monitoring, advanced treatment technologies, and long-term sustainability through rainwater harvesting.

## Key Features
- **Demand Estimation:** Detailed analysis of campus-wide water requirements, estimated at approximately 3.87 million liters per day.  
- **Water Quality Analytics:** Comparative study of water parameters (Turbidity, pH, Iron levels) between 2022 and 2023.  
- **Real-time IoT Integration:** Proposal for hostel-level water purity monitoring using multi-parameter sensors and a mobile feedback system (OneStop integration).  
- **Advanced Treatment Solutions:** Implementation strategies for Electrocoagulation (EC) and UV Disinfection to neutralize modern pathogens.  
- **Sustainable Infrastructure:** Comprehensive plan for rooftop rainwater harvesting capable of collecting 1.15 crore liters per year for large hostels.  

##  Proposed Technical Stack & Solutions
**Monitoring:**  
- Tuya WiFi Smart Water Quality Multimeters for tracking pH, TDS, EC, and Salinity.  

**Treatment:**  
- **Short-term:** Industrial UV Water Treatment Systems  
- **Mid-term:** Electrocoagulation systems for chemical-free contaminant removal  
- **Tertiary:** Activated Carbon Filtration (ACF) and advanced sewage treatment  

**Sustainability:**  
- Rainwater Harvesting (RWH) with groundwater recharge pits  

##  Data Insights
- **Declining Source Levels:** Analysis of the Brahmaputra River shows a significant decline in average dry season discharge since 1970, leading to higher contamination concentrations.  
- **Storage Gaps:** Sector-wise storage capacity analysis reveals imbalances, with Sector-2 having the lowest capacity (2.50 lakh Liters), contributing to localized water scarcity.  

## ⚠️ Challenges Identified
- Undetected pipeline leakages causing significant water wastage  
- Inability of current systems to treat advanced pathogens like antibiotics and industrial waste  
- Iron content consistently exceeding permissible limits (>0.3 mg/L)  

##  Strategic Solutions
- **Standardizing Storage:** Upgrading water tanks in low-capacity sectors to ensure equitable distribution  
- **Solar-Powered Pumping:** Utilizing low-energy solar pumps to maintain water pressure in high-altitude areas  
- **Policy Reform:** Establishing a Water Conservation Committee and implementing an Annual Water Report  

## 🏆 Project Achievements
- Secured **Rank 2** in the Kriti Case Competition  
- Developed by **Team 57**
